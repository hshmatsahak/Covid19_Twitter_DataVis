"I served in the military in the Vietnam years.I volunteered, but the majority of those who served along side me or died in that war were draftees.Tell them being asked to wear a mask is a violation of one's rights. It’s a bona fide civic good.The DOD should conscript all of them! ",

"@BeardOfLiberty @GregAbbott_TX I’m a nurse. I don’t have a beard but I do wear a mask every damn day. I don’t have difficulty breathing. I have witnessed people on vents, however, experience much difficulty breathing. Mask vs intubation. Selfish people infuriate me",

"Your “freedom” was never taken away in the first place. All that was asked is that you stay home a bit, wear a mask over your nose and mouth for the stake of peoples lives.",

Human rights should not be up for debate. Make noise until everyone involved in the sex ring is arrested. Make noise until Breonna Taylor gets justice. Make noise until our leaders actually represent and work for the people. And wear a fucking mask while doing it. (4/4),

@fredpotter2hotm @OKnox @bylenasun @isaacstanbecker Same. Folks complaining about infringement of their freedoms because they were asked to wear a mask while my actual freedom was impacted because I couldn't risk being out in our area due to the lack of masks and the belief covid was a hoax.

I’m still not understanding the logic behind being anti mask or preventative measures against Covid-19. Is it just to be anti-establishment on not to be a “sheep”? Because science sure isn’t on your side...ñ,
Y’all this is some Illegal government control bull shit. #gtfo #masksdonothing #itsallaboutcontrol ,
Florida is an oasis of freedom from COVID restrictions. I haven't worn a mask since the airport.,
"Impatient/privilege-filled Americans ""tired"" of lockdown during #coronavirus #pandemic whilst opening economy too quickly, claiming their freedom is being stifled, going mask-less and not social distancing are irritating. Do the right thing. Suck it up and #StayHome #SaferAtHome",
I do not understand the people who wear a mask with things like “this is useless” and “this is not freedom”. Obviously the people who wear it is white people. Specifically middle-aged suburban white people.,
To stop the Covid madness we need a brave large retail chain run by conservatives to stop requiring worthless masks. They are terrified people won’t shop in their stores if the sheep aren’t wearing masks. This is all about money and fear.,

@RandPaul not only do you have to wear a mask after vaccination your still required a recent covid test to go to Hawaii without having to quarantine for 2 weeks. My niece a nurse who's been vaccinated is planning a trip and still has to get a covid test. GET THE FACTS MORON ,

@LynnforAnne @LouWho59 @SpencerJCox I’d like to meet the person who ENJOYS masking up to go to the grocery store or work or school. Very few if any exist. If the government can mandate you wear a seatbelt and not drive drunk I think they are within rights to make you wear a mask.,
@JessicaTarlov How can you say the #Orthodox #jews should not protest without masks...it’s the only way as per #BLMRiots  Our freedom is being confiscated by #Democrats! The #COVID19 rules only apply to those who follow the rules. #MAGA2020,

"Wearing a mask is not a constitutional,  or a freedom decision.  It's a health decision,  pure and simple. We are all being held hostage by this kind of thinking. Until this virus is under control, there will be no normal again. People refusing to wear masks, is the problem.",

Hot Take of The Day: Being #prochoice does NOT mean pro-abortion.  It means I can decide what happens to my body... just like y’all want to decide if you want to wear a mask on your body.  You can’t pick and choose what you want to interpret as “personal rights”.,
