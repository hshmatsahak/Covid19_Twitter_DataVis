This man maybe makes $20/hr and you think he cares about what some blue checkmark says about him on Twitter? Hell no. Andy is just trying to make it back home after a 10 hour shift before another Becky attacks him for someone else not wearing a mask. ,
"@llambchops @ColonelsCONEX While I respect your opinion, I have one of my own. The lockdowns and mandates aren't ""doing shit"" because too many people fail to comply. As long as people are dying of COVID, I will mask up and stay at home.",
"@petersabuchan1 I will also say that I firmly believe that we aren't fighting this pandemic as effectively as we could because there have been no nation wide mandates. Urban cities require masks, suburbs don't.  Less populous states have not required it, more populous have.",
Some guy I use to work with that is going to PA school is really out at some super packed rave gathering🥴no social distancing or masks in sight..... and these are the health care providers of our future 🤔🤔.,
